=====

`aeiou` is a web-based API for text-to-speech using the DECTalk engine.  You may
recognize this particular speech-synthesis engine from various videogames and
YouTube videos.

In order to install it, you need Windows (or Wine on Linux) and a copy of
DECTalk (I'm using version 4.61).

See [`decwav/README.md`](decwav/README.md) for instructions on how to build
`decwav.exe`, which the webserver uses to process text-to-speech requests.

Please contact me if you would like to try out the copy I am hosting.
